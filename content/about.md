I am a Research Scientist (RSE-IV) at UW ILABS, where with Professor Patricia Kuhl, I study the underlying electrophysiology of language brain functioning. I received my doctoral training in cognition at the University of Munster, Institute for Biosignal and Biomagnetic Analysis where I was trained to use MEEG technology to characterize neural electrophysiology in the human brain.

Subsequently, I joined the Department of Radiology at CHOP where I worked as a post-doctoral fellow with Dr. Tim Roberts and Professor David Embick to develop experimental psycholinguistic tasks to study abnormal language brain function in children with Autism. At present, with Dr. Kuhl I am using MEG and spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging to look at:

-   speech processing in infants
-   semantics and cortical excitability in Autism
-   functional connectivity
