## Gender

If gender is a spectrum then Darwinian natural selection implies that for a given set containing a pair of modern phenotypic variants in set `{a: 'xx', b: 'xy'}` Bayes law says the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions (embryologic, mother's health) might be related to specified gender event.

## Ontogensis of organic intelligence

A unified theory of human intelligence requires an explanation of the elegant _dimorphism_, which unquestionaby shapes the ontogenesis of a person through their life span, effecting not only their personal politics but that of culture itself, e.g., abortion in the U.S. Alas, gender politics is well beyond the pruveiew of this treastise. I will leave it up to the reader to decide personally regarding the impact of this Godonkin.

A comprehensive explanation of human intelligence should satisfy a finite set of biophysical conditions. These conditions are the culmination of 2-3 centuries of scientific work including but not limited to:

* Phylogensis - a process of active moiety caused by natural selection resulting in the template _male_ and _female_ genders characterized by differences amongst principle human biological ground truths such as gonadotropic differentiation of reproductive biology, CNS lateralization [Aboitiz], and resting state functional organization [REFS].

  * Following gross phenotypic morphology throughout the lifespan, the human brain shows remarkable ability to fold, fit, and connect atop our primitive reptilian and sub-cortical structures through an evolutionary feat of terminal expansion [REFS]. Afterall, with reference to the spacetime continuum _the human brain from fetus to grave is a glucose rich amalgamation of genetic debris floating on said spacetime continuum._ Otherwise, what reason would natural selection have to select for _intelligence_ capable of building _rigourous_ AI?

    Make no mistake, intelligence, the organic iteration is a product of [SEL] and is inextricably linked to the Hubbel-Wieselesque computational organic materials folded onto the spacetime continuum.

  * A Cartesian representation of 3D space in the evolutionary process of climbing down from trees to tool use [Vygotsky], requires, I posit a morph map
        from the [cerebrospinal axis](https://bit.ly/3nLk9ct) onto 3D reality (\\R), that attempts to account for the great [dessuccation]NB evolutionary references rezuired.
* Causation - _apriori_ every child event is more or less a chance event with roughly equal probability for specified genotypic event ('xx' or 'xy'). For a random seed (child) the spatiotemporal window of life (simulation) under selective pressure is a thermodynamic gradient minimum determining ontogensis. Thus, life itself is an echo.
