In his infinite wisdom, Gauss imparted what remains to date as a bedrock for numerous explanations in the _sciences_. But in the social sciences, the Gaussian curve has
been a source of consternation.<sup>1</sup> 

For the purpose of a unified explanation of human mentation, however, the Gaussian kernel has been a boon to neuroimaging. Unlike any other construct, the Gaussian kernel has helped unify the mesoscale mapping of brain function using electrophysiology and functional neuroimaging. Nonetheless, the enterprise to map brain activity to brain locale has consistently been at odds with histology's detailed mappings. Thus a unified explanation of the neocortex and by extension [g] illudes the scientific community [Posner]. 

A formal definition of general
intelligence [g] as a dynamic
_scalar_ modulator of CNS activity (Binet, Duncan, others) is encaptured by the manifold of spacetime captured by integrating cortical activity under a given kernel [g]. This way, general intelligence may be conceived as the sum of real-time perturbations on a sphere representing the two lobes in the mammalian brain. In the mammalian neocortex, the sphere is bisected and elaborately folded by evolutionary processes to arrive at an optimal connectivity
solution to facilitate the communication between distant brain regions
necessary for behavior. Extensive anatomical parcellation
techniques have shown that cytoarchitectonic boundaries are notoriously tricky to
define operationally. Here let the manifold of space (S) on the superficial layer (VI) of the mammalian cortex be the full width of a kernel [g]. Where [g] as a _receptive_ EMF is constrained by histology and gross pyramidal IO. By restricting fuzziness to the superficial layers, [g] operationalizes the entire "neural representation" of e.g., the Pennfield Homonculus and provides for near-simultaneous integration of bilateral dorsoventral streams of information [Fuster]. By near-simultaneous, I am referring to the principle that cognition takes time [Posner]. 
Furthermore, there is no reason to believe that a spatiotemporal manifold "neural represntation" of behavior goes against a modular organization of brain function. Because, granularly, [g] is limited to spacetime spanning a cortical column, and by definition, the canonical computational unit-tests (Ï†) for a Gestalt. 
Lastly, as a metric scalar at any
given moment [g] is the manifold across the entire grey-matter space, mesially, with a traveling FWHM along the mesial layers. A traveling FWHM allows modeling E/I balance () by narrowing the neural matrix space for re-entrants and gating I/O along the grey-white matter surface. Further, this view may account for higher frequency oscillatory activity, which presumably can enhance information flow between regions brought closer together by cortical folding (cross ref with Casanova shower curtain model of ASD). Incidentally, fast oscillations "jumping" across gyri can not only speed up communications that otherwise travel via arcuate fibers. Likewise, the variable spread of activity across gyri can also underly some forms of epileptic activity. 
With. In this view, the
canonical Broadmanns areas or swaths of regions deemed critical to e.g.
language function contribute a communal [g] at a cost reflected in the BOLD signal.
